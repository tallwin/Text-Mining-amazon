This is a phenomenon seen in all LCDs that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad Air 4. Its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. Where as it is it is opposite in ipad Air 4 due to space challenges inside. So ipad Air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. Google gives more info on this subject. Even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.For battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. In 43k you get A15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. Unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t buy this from Amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t buy this from Amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",

Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use.

You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",

Its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. Where as it is it is opposite in ipad Air 4 due to space challenges inside. So ipad Air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. Google gives more info on this subject.

In 43k you get A15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. Unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",

I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it.

This is a phenomenon seen in all LCDs that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad Air 4. Its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. Where as it is it is opposite in ipad Air 4 due to space challenges inside. So ipad Air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. Google gives more info on this subject. Even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.For battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. In 43k you get A15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. Unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t buy this from Amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t buy this from Amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t buy this from Amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",

Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use.

You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",

Its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. Where as it is it is opposite in ipad Air 4 due to space challenges inside. So ipad Air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. Google gives more info on this subject.

In 43k you get A15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. Unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",

I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it.

This is a phenomenon seen in all LCDs that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad Air 4. Its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. Where as it is it is opposite in ipad Air 4 due to space challenges inside. So ipad Air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. Google gives more info on this subject. Even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.For battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. In 43k you get A15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. Unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t buy this from Amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

I am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.Original review:The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.Notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-A15 chip: This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front-Redesigned like Air: Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.Multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option. Now with the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads. It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil. For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t buy this from Amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price. The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil. This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t buy this from Amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can\\'t see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today\\'s use. There isn\\'t any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. I personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers. Lastly Apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in India, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by Apple in India.\\n\\n',\n",

              "'  update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen

the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but

ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥

for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return

7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price

the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable

just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely

controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a

percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size

port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly

this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web

tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it

i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera to performance and display everything is just awesome 😍🔥 i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound

i use for video editing and gaming   the smaller the size the bigger the performance, it\\'s the best ipad till date as per my opinion.the only con is the ipad is not for the people who want to have ipad as a cell phone i.e. you cannot call or text through ipad irrespective of the cellular modal otherwise  it\\'s and outstanding piece.   64 gb is not enough and 256 is overpriced in india, it should have been priced less than 50k. i bought it just for the form factor.   update:for people complaining unnecessarily of jelly scroll, have not used an lcd panel before. this is a phenomenon seen in all lcds that refresh at 60 hz including othet brand tablets and other ipads like ipad air 4. its just that the refresh controller on the ipad mini 6 is placed vertically in portrait mode and horizontally in landscape mode. where as it is it is opposite in ipad air 4 due to space challenges inside. so ipad air 4 will jelly scroll when in landscape mode. google gives more info on this subject. even my samsung fold 3 for 1.4 lakhs also jelly scrolls.for battery, i do get 9-10 hrs at medium brightness so no complaints in that department. in 43k you get a15 chip with latest hardware and a usb c. unfortunately we have either 64gb or 256gb model, but 64 gigs also suffices as we have a usb c port. i am able to transfer the data directly to a usb c pen drive easily.original review:the new 6th gen ipad mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous ipad mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the ipad air.notable upgrades over previous ipad mini are:-screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.-a15 chip: this is the latest apple chip, previous version was a12-cameras: 12mp rear and 12mp front cameras, previous version was 8mp rear and 7mp front-redesigned like air: slightly different shape, no home button, usb-c instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd gen pencil charging on side.multiple color options available but i loved the new starlight.if you don\\'t need a larger screen, this ipad mini is a great option. now with the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support like the ipad air, combined with the a15 chip and center stage front cameras, this mini has some of the best features of the other ipads. it is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd gen pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls. with the latest chip and os, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.this could be worth upgrading from the previous ipad mini, especially if you love the 2nd gen pencil. for me, the usb-c and 2nd gen pencil support makes it worth the higher price. the way the 2nd gen pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st gen pencil. this is probably the most-value-for-money ipad at the moment, and is the one i\\'m using most often now because of the convenient size.   unfortunately, i couldn\\'t buy this from amazon as they didn\\'t have stock. i had to buy it from reliance digital which doesn\\'t even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. however, my experience and opinion is fairly given.one of the most hyped launch. this size doesn\\'t fit all the use cases. it is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is not meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.pros:excellent a15 bionic chip. fast and efficient. however note that the cpu is throttled to a14 like performance while gpu is better. i am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn\\'t bother me.good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.wifi and bluetooth works well in range but i noticed the sound level is less when connected to bluetooth headphones.front camera good with centre stage function.rear camera is again 12 mp, but i can\\'t see much use to it in an ipad. has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.cons:screen has jelly scroll in portrait mode. right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. can cause nauseating feel. for pages with videos like in you tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. this is the major issue with this mini 6 display.the aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. apps don\\'t fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3\" meaningless.if anyone can really ignore this screen flaw (i can\\'t personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.the next worse thing is the battery life. with a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with wifi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. they should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. my earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. if you do gaming or use productivity apps or apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. standby time is excellent though (a small concession).ipados 15 for mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. all the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. not sure if apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. they just applied what is meant for bigger ipads to mini which doesn\\'t go well.storage of 64 gb is just not fair for today\\'s use. there isn\\'t any option for 128 gb.with the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 gb storage and average battery life for a cost of 47k (640$) meant for a base model (case, screen protector and apple pencil will add upto another 15k) its just not worth it. you feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn\\'t bother you. i personally can\\'t recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. the hype is just not worth it.note: apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the us and europe. however, in india it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. however, the price is more than that they have for other markets. another joke from apple for its indian customers. lastly apple doesn\\'t have any stores of its own in india, their franchised service centres are run by incompetent people who doesn\\'t understand any issues and are reluctant to support your cause due to such limited setup by apple in india.   go for it. you won\\'t regret it. from camera
